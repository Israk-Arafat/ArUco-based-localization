# ArUco Marker Map Configuration
# Defines the known positions of ArUco markers in the world (map frame)
#
# Coordinate System:
#   - X: forward (typical convention)
#   - Y: left
#   - Z: up
#
# Position: [x, y, z] in meters from map origin
# Orientation: [x, y, z, w] quaternion (optional, default is identity)
#
# For a simple room setup:
#   - Place markers on walls at known positions
#   - Measure positions relative to a chosen origin (e.g., room corner)

markers:
  # Marker 0: Origin marker (at map origin, facing +X direction)
  - id: 0
    position: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    orientation: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]  # No rotation

  # Marker 1: 3 meters forward from origin
  - id: 1
    position: [3.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    orientation: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]

  # Marker 2: To the left side
  - id: 2
    position: [1.5, 2.0, 0.0]
    orientation: [0.0, 0.0, 0.7071068, 0.7071068]  # 90° rotation around Z (facing -X)
    description: "Left side marker"
  
  # Marker 3: To the right side
  - id: 3
    position: [1.5, -2.0, 0.0]
    orientation: [0.0, 0.0, -0.7071068, 0.7071068]  # -90° rotation around Z (facing +X)
    description: "Right side marker"

# Notes for physical deployment:
# 1. Print ArUco markers from the DICT_4X4_50 dictionary (or your chosen dictionary)
# 2. Measure and record actual positions in your test environment
# 3. Mount markers securely on walls at consistent height
# 4. Update this file with actual measured positions
# 5. Markers should be large enough for detection from expected distances
#    (recommended: 10-20cm for indoor use at 1-3 meter distances)
